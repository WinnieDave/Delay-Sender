# Delay-Sender
Simple email client which works with *@mail.ru adresses.Reborn.
Now it looks like this
![Main Window](https://github.com/WinnieDave/Delay-Sender/tree/Images/MainWindowImage.png)
![Error message/Can`t send email](https://github.com/WinnieDave/Delay-Sender/tree/Images/ErrorMessage.png)
![Notification about sent email](https://github.com/WinnieDave/Delay-Sender/tree/Images/MessageSentImage.png)
![Login Window(first window,that user can see when launching app](https://github.com/WinnieDave/Delay-Sender/tree/Images/LoginImage.png)
But I am working on creating more user-frendly interface
